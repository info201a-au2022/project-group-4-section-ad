intro_blurb <- "Have you ever wanted to get into working out, but always thought that the IMA was too intimidating?
According to the New York post, almost 50% of Americans are intimidated by the prospect of working out
at a public gym. This project seeks to alleviate this issue for University of Washington students by answering the following question: How many people
are at the IMA at any given time? To answer this question, we are analyzing data gathered on how crowded Berkeley's campus gym is throughout the year.
We hope that by answering this topic, we're able to help students new to the IMA find less crowded times
to workout and get started. Additionally, even seasoned gym-goers will be able to use our project to find the
optimal time to work out for maximum efficiency."

                        and see that the person count could go over 100. But they can also see that as the temperature lowers
