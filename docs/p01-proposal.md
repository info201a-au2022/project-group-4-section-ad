### Abstract
Our main question is how do external factors affect people's willingness to go to the gym. This question is important because in order to make gym-going easier, we want to provide newcomers times to go to the gym when crowdiness is at its least. To address this question, we will perform an analysis on teamperature, weather, seasons, time, and their relationship on gym crowdiness. 

### Keywords
Gym, fitness, foot traffic 

### Introduction
The Intramural Activities building (IMA)  is one of many great resources offered to students attending the University of Washington. Although the IMA is free, many students still do not take full advantage of the facility due to the intimidating environment that surrounds the building. Our goal with this project is to make going to the IMA easier for students who are looking to start working out. We plan to primarily address this issue by analyzing a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nsrose7224/crowdedness-at-the-campus-gym?datasetId=527) that tracks crowdiness at a campus gym. 

In order to effectively provide students a comprehensive idea of when good times to go to the gym are, we’ll pull data of crowdiness at different times by weekday, with exceptions on holidays. Seeing as how the University gym (Brekeley) in the dataset is of a very similar size, crowdedness is assumed to be similar in number. Additional segmentations for the dataset includes weather, seasons, and temperature. All of this data will be analyzed and provided to students to find a good time to go to the gym when crowdiness is at it’s minimum. 

### Problem Domain

### Research Questions
**Is there a relationship between day of the week and gym crowdiness?**
Each day comes with different commitments - people may be busy with class and commitments one day, but have nothing on the weekends. We want to see whether there are big differences in the amount of people there during the weekend compared to the number of people there on a weekday and single-out days with the least traffic.

**How does rainy weather affect people’s willingness to go to the gym?**
Weather condition is an important factor when people decide to go outside or not, and going to the IMA is no exception. We want to see if there is a connection between harsh weather and gym attendance with the goal of calculating an average change metric when it is raining. 

**Do weekends and holidays affect gym traffic?**
Holidays and seasons may have an effect on gym attendance - an example of this would be a spike in gym traffic following New Year or a dip in gym traffic during Thanksgiving break. We want to find out whether holidays affect gym attendance and on an even broader scale, whether different seasons have varying attendance levels.

### Appendix A: Questions
We only have one dataset, but it is very thorough with **11** comprehensive variables and **26,000** observations which gives us plenty of data to work with. Can we go through with using just this dataset, as it is also very specific and it may be hard for us to find other relevant datasets that won't detract from our analysis? We think this dataset
